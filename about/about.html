            <p class="information">ChoreClap is a platform to make our urban/rural lives more fulfilling to solve our needs in a clap. Hence the name, ChoreClap. It enables users to find any service professional like a plumber, a wedding photographer, a yoga teacher, or an interior designer. We want to be the go-to platform which helps customers complete the projects that are important to their lives – everything from designing their homes to capturing key moments, learning arts, filing taxes, and getting healthier etc.</p>

            <h1 align="center"> Our Aim</h1>
            <p class="aim">ChoreClap uses technology to simplify the process of finding the right service professional. So far, companies like JustDial have just created listing platforms. The objective of ChoreClap is to go a step further and enable users to find and hire the right professional for all their needs. When choice is not a priority (e.g. carpenters, plumbers) customers can go ahead and book a service on the website, and the professional will show up at the pre-appointed time. When choice and other factors come in, for instance in the case of wedding photographers, yoga instructors and makeup artists, then ChoreClap matches the customers’ requirements with professionals who can fulfil these needs.
